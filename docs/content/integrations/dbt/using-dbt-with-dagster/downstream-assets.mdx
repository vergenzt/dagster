# Using dbt with Dagster, part four: Add a downstream asset

<Note>
  This is part four of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

By this point, you've [set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/set-up-dbt-project), [loaded dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models), and [defined assets upstream of your dbt models](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/upstream-assets).

In this step, you'll:

- [Install the plotly library](#step-1-install-the-plotly-library)
- [Define a downstream asset that computes a chart using plotly](#step-2-define-the-order_count_chart-asset)
- [Materialize the `order_count_chart` asset](#step-3-materialize-the-order_count_chart-asset)

---

## Step 1: Install the plotly library

```shell
pip install plotly
```

---

## Step 2: Define the order_count_chart asset

You've added upstream assets to your data pipeline, but nothing downstream - until now. In this step, you'll define a Dagster asset called `order_count_chart` that uses the data in the `customers` dbt model to computes a plotly chart of the number of orders per customer.

Like the `raw_customers` asset that we added in the [previous section](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/upstream-assets#step-2-define-an-upstream-dagster-asset), we'll put this asset in our `definitions.py` file, inside the `jaffle_dagster` directory.

To add the `order_count_chart` asset:

1. Replace the imports section with the following:

   ```python file=integrations/dbt/tutorial/downstream_assets/assets.py startafter=start_imports endbefore=end_imports
   import os

   import duckdb
   import pandas as pd
   import plotly.express as px
   from dagster import MetadataValue, AssetExecutionContext, asset
   from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, dbt_assets, get_asset_key_for_model

   from .project import dbt_project
   ```

   This adds an import for plotly, as well as <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="get_asset_key_for_model" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="MetadataValue" />, which we'll use in our asset.

2. After your definition of `jaffle_shop_dbt_assets`, add the definition for the `order_count_chart` asset:

   ```python file=integrations/dbt/tutorial/downstream_assets/assets.py startafter=start_downstream_asset endbefore=end_downstream_asset
   @asset(
       compute_kind="python",
       deps=[get_asset_key_for_model([jaffle_shop_dbt_assets], "customers")],
   )
   def order_count_chart(context: AssetExecutionContext):
       # read the contents of the customers table into a Pandas DataFrame
       connection = duckdb.connect(os.fspath(duckdb_database_path))
       customers = connection.sql("select * from customers").df()

       # create a plot of number of orders by customer and write it out to an HTML file
       fig = px.histogram(customers, x="number_of_orders")
       fig.update_layout(bargap=0.2)
       save_chart_path = duckdb_database_path.parent.joinpath("order_count_chart.html")
       fig.write_html(save_chart_path, auto_open=True)

       # tell Dagster about the location of the HTML file,
       # so it's easy to access from the Dagster UI
       context.add_output_metadata(
           {"plot_url": MetadataValue.url("file://" + os.fspath(save_chart_path))}
       )
   ```

   This asset definition looks similar the asset we defined in the previous section. In this case, instead of fetching data from an external source and writing it to DuckDB, it reads data from DuckDB, and then uses it to make a plot.

   The line `deps=get_asset_key_for_model([jaffle_shop_dbt_assets], "customers")` tells Dagster that this asset is downstream of the `customers` dbt model. This dependency will be displayed as such in Dagster's UI. If you launch a run to materialize both of them, Dagster won't run `order_count_chart` until `customers` completes.

3. Add the `order_count_chart` to the `Definitions`:

   ```python file=integrations/dbt/tutorial/downstream_assets/definitions.py startafter=start_defs endbefore=end_defs
   from dagster import Definitions
   from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource

   from .assets import jaffle_shop_dbt_assets, order_count_chart, raw_customers
   from .project import dbt_project
   from .schedules import schedules

   defs = Definitions(
       assets=[raw_customers, jaffle_shop_dbt_assets, order_count_chart],
       schedules=schedules,
       resources={
           "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=dbt_project),
       },
   )
   ```

---

## Step 3: Materialize the order_count_chart asset

If the Dagster UI is still running from the previous section, click the "Reload Definitions" button in the upper right corner. If you shut it down, then you can launch it again with the same command from the previous section:

```shell
dagster dev
```

The UI will look like this:

<!--
![Asset group with dbt models and Python asset](/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/downstream-assets/asset-graph.png)
-->

<Image
alt="Asset group with dbt models and Python asset"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/downstream-assets/asset-graph.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

A new asset named `order_count_chart` is at the bottom, downstream of the `customers` asset. Click on `order_count_chart` and click **Materialize selected**.

That's it! When the run successfully completes, the following chart will automatically open in your browser:

<!--
![plotly chart asset displayed in Chrome](/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/downstream-assets/order-count-chart.png)
-->

/>

That's the end of this tutorial - congratulations! By now, you should have a working dbt and Dagster integration and a handful of materialized Dagster assets.
